# Java-QAP3-Semester3

## Advanced Java Programming - Course Assessment

### **Introduction**

This repository contains solutions for the **Quantitative Assessment Practice (QAP)** as part of the **Advanced Java Programming** course. The assessment evaluates students' grasp of Java concepts covered in previous lessons. Completion of the assessment is mandatory, and students must finish at least **80%** of the assigned QAPs per course.

---

## **Assessment Breakdown**

The assessment consists of **four problems**, each focusing on different aspects of Java, including **inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces**. These problems assess the practical application of theoretical concepts.

### **Problem 1: School Management System**

- Implementation of **Teacher** and **CollegeStudent** classes.
- These classes extend **Person** and **Student**, adding specialized attributes.

### **Problem 2: Point and MovablePoint**

- Implementation of **Point** and **MovablePoint** classes as per a given class diagram.
- The **MovablePoint** class extends **Point** by adding speed properties.
- A demo class tests the movement of the point.

### **Problem 3: Abstract Classes and Shapes**

- Design of a shape hierarchy with **Ellipse, Circle, Triangle, and EquilateralTriangle**.
- An abstract superclass **Shape** defines common properties.
- Each subclass implements **getArea()** and **getPerimeter()** methods.

### **Problem 4: Interfaces and Scalability**

- A **Scalable** interface is introduced.
- The **Shape** class is modified to implement **Scalable**.
- Subclasses override the **scale()** method to resize shapes dynamically.

## **Deliverables**

Each problem requires:

- Fully functional **Java class files** with proper documentation.
- A **screenshot** showing successful execution of the code.
